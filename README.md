# Readers-Writers problem
Readers-writers problem portrays a common situation where one piece of data is both read and modified. There are two types of processes: readers and writers. Multiple readers can read data at the same time. Writer needs exclusive access to data, to modify it. The challenge in this problem is establishing a priority for writers in such a way that readers are not starved.
